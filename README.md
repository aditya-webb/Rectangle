2.Customize

Edit index.html to update your profile content (name, bio, links).

Modify styles.css to change colours, layout, typography.

If needed, adjust script.js to add interactive features (e.g., theme toggle, animations).

Add or remove assets (images, icons) as per your preference.

3.Deploy / Publish

If you‚Äôre using GitHub Pages: you can serve the index.html (e.g., from the main branch or gh-pages branch).

Make sure your repository settings or CNAME (if custom domain) are correct.

4.Update & Maintain

Commit changes with good commit messages (‚Äúupdate bio‚Äù, ‚Äúrefresh theme colours‚Äù, etc.).

Tag releases if you‚Äôd like versioning of major profile updates.

5. Customization Tips
Consider adding profiles for light/dark theme toggles in styles.css.

Use CSS variables (:root { --primary-colour: #‚Ä¶ }) to make theme changes easier.

Use modern CSS layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid) for responsiveness.

Optimize your images/icons (SVG or compressed PNG) so the profile loads fast.

If you add JS features, make sure they don‚Äôt interfere with accessibility.
